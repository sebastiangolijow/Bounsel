# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I send 8 hours in it.

The most difficult part for me was the database and the connection, because I have been working with Salesforce for the last few months I didn;t remember very well how I had to make the connection between the database and the backend, I spend a few more hours in that but I think it resolved it good enough. If I had more days I could have done a better job and a more complete functionality. Sorry fot that.

I have been using this user: test+1@onestic.com and password: 1234567890
I reuse a part of a front end that I did a little bit ago with React for another test, hope this doesn't bother.
Hope you like it, best regards.
